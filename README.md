## Project Overview

This Java application is a simple example to help DevOps engineers understand how to work with Java apps in a containerized environment. It can be used as a learning tool for creating and managing CI/CD pipelines and deploying Java applications to various environments.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Hassan-Eid-Hassan/java.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

    ```shell
    docker build -t java-app .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:

    ```shell
    docker run -d -p 8090:8090 java-app
    ```

## Usage

Once the container is running, the Java application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. You can interact with the application through the provided endpoints.

## Creating a Pipeline

This repository serves as a learning platform for creating a DevOps pipeline. You can experiment with various CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD to create a pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the Java application. 

For example, you might:

- **Build** the application using Maven or Gradle.
- **Test** the application using JUnit or other testing frameworks.
- **Deploy** the containerized application to a staging or production environment.

Feel free to explore and customize the pipeline according to your learning goals.
